 **Contributors**:  Ryan Armes, Cooper Kelly, Temitayo Oladeji, Cori DeBeatham


**Project Name**: Spot - Parking Garage Locator

**Data Source - NYC Open Data:** https://nycopendata.socrata.com/w/5bhr-pjxt/25te-f2tw?cur=_W5UT2uwPYufrom=5A1b5dAfjwW

### Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Google Geoencoding API
* GoogleMaps JavaScript API 


### Primary Objective
The search for parking can cause major conjestion in big cities, especially when there are events like concerts or parades. Our goal is to help eliminate congestion by allowing users to see the closest garages with free spaces. By avoiding full garages and diverting their attention to garages with free space, this could help with decongestion.

### Challenges
* Learning how to use an API.
* Deciding what data was useable.
* How to go about finding the location.
* Trying to use a database.
* Trying to access a local json file from the web.
* Trying to build the project without interfering with other teamates works. Caused gaps of inactivity.

### What We Would Expand On
* Right now, our database only contains about 30 garages from the Bronx NY. We like to expand on our data if given more time.
* As of right now, external sources, like actual parking garage companies cannot manage their "capcity". We would implement this by using an actual database. 

### Instructions

* Click sign in and create an account if needed.
* After signing in, you will be redirected to the main locator.
* Enter your current location and use the slider to manage your budget.
* Click search to find the 5 closest garages fitting your budget.
* Click on the markers on the map to see which garage from the list is located there.
